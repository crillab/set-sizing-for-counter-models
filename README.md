# set-sizing-for-counter-models
## Building
- Before running ``make``, a pseudo-Boolean solver and [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/tree/master/src) are necessary.
- In Makefile, three variables must be correctly set in order for this tool to work.
  - PUGIXML_SRC must be set to the location of the file pugixml.cpp.
  - PUGIXML_LIB must be set to the directory containing the other two source files of pugixml.
  - PB_SOLVER must be set to the command for running the chosen pseudo-Boolean solver, or to the path to its executable.

## Usage
- As inputs, the path to a POG file and the positive, natural upper-bound for searching for set sizes must be given as arguments.
- As outputs, if possible, there will be four files named according to the stem of the input POG.
  - `<stem>.abs_out` lists the originally abstract sets followed immediately and most interestingly by the first propositional variable that represents one of its elements. Its elements' variables are contiguous.
  - `<stem>_concrete.pog` is the new POG file instantiating the abstract sets of the input.
  - `<stem>.pbo` is the pseudo-Boolean problem instance encoding the original POG file.
  - `<stem>.pb_solver_out` has the output of the pseudo-Boolean solver piped into it.

### Run
- ./set-sizing-for-counter-models -i `<input POG>` -k `<upper-bound on set size>`
